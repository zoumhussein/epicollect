**EpiCollect** provides a mobile phone and web application for the generation of forms and freely hosted project websites (using Google's AppEngine) for many kinds of mobile data collection projects.

Here you will find the code for the Android app (rest coming soon)

Data can be collected using multiple mobile phones running either the Android Operating system or the iPhone (using the EpiCollect mobile app) and all data can be synchronised from the phones and viewed centrally  via the Project website (hosted on AppEngine) or directly on the phones.

EpiCollect is developed by David Aanensen, Derek Huntley and Chris Powell at Imperial College London.
